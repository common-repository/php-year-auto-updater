Enables a shortcode to always show the current year.

== Description ==
Enables a shortcode to always show the current year. This is very useful in footer copy where it's best to always show the current year, and you don't have to remember to update it every year.

== Installation ==
Navigate to /wp-admin/plugins.php and upload the zip file, or search for this plugin in the WordPress Plugin Repository using the interface. You can also FTP the unzipped directory to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

After you activate the plugin, use [php-year] wherever you want the current year to appear.

== Changelog ==
3.17.19 -- Added a valid readme.txt file
